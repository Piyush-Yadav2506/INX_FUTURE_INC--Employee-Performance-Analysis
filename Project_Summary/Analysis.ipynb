    "# Analysis – Interpreting Data and Summary of Various Choices\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. ML Algorithm and Training Methods Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple machine learning algorithms were evaluated, including **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, SVM, and XGBoost**.\n",
    "- The **best-performing model was XGBoost**, selected based on highest test accuracy, precision, and F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Most Important Features Selected & Why\n",
    "\n",
    "### Top 3 Features Affecting Employee Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **EmpLastSalaryHikePercent** – High salary hikes correlated with strong performance, indicating recognition and motivation are drivers.\n",
    "2. **EmpJobSatisfaction & EmpWorkLifeBalance** – Both strongly correlated with better performance; low scores signaled higher underperformance and disengagement.\n",
    "3. **YearsSinceLastPromotion** – Longer intervals without promotion correlated with underperformance, indicating career stagnation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering & Selection Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Included data cleaning, handling missing values, fixing data types, and removing outliers.\n",
    "- Transformations used: **Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, Standard Scaling**.\n",
    "- Transformations done using **Column Transformer**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Other Techniques and Tools Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automated EDA**: Utilized **Sweetviz** for quick, visual insights into the data distributions and outliers.\n",
    "- **Quality Checks**: Data processed to remove or clarify real outlier issues.\n",
    "- **Business Problem Framing**: Segmented analysis to address department-wise performance, identify non-performing employees, and rank important performance factors.\n",
    "- Used **joblib** for saving/loading models and encoders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Feature Engineering Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data was split into train/test using sklearn, ensuring robust validation.\n",
    "- Outliers were scrutinized—correlations and feature interactions considered in determining their impact.\n",
    "- Final cleaned dataset saved for reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Results, Analysis, and Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Comparison:\n",
    "- XGBoost and Gradient Boosting are the only models that consistently handle class 4 well.\n",
    "- AdaBoost, SVM, and Logistic Regression struggle significantly with class 4 — low recall and F1.\n",
    "- Gradient Boosting is a close second, slightly less robust on class 4.\n",
    "- Random Forest is strong but slightly weaker on minority class.\n",
    "- Decision Tree generalizes decently but overfits hard.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression and SVM are interpretable but underperform.\n",
    "- AdaBoost is not viable for use case as performance is poor.\n",
    "- **Final Verdict XGBoost** is your **best model** — highest test F1, strong precision, and solid handling of all classes.\n",
    "- **XGBoost outperformed** after hyperparameter tuning other models on test accuracy (93%) and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Business Insights:\n",
    "- Departments and employees with higher salary growth and satisfaction are high performers.\n",
    "- Work-life balance is critical for retention and performance.\n",
    "- Lack of promotion is a warning sign for HR intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Questions Answered:\n",
    "- **Which factors drive performance?** (Salary hike, satisfaction, promotion)\n",
    "- **How are departments performing, and who are non-performers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clear Impact:\n",
    "Analysis enables strategic workforce management, targeted engagement, and fair performance rewards."
